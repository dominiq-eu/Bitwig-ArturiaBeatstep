# Arturia Beatstep Control script for Bitwig

In this package are two different control scripts, named BeatStep-MidiMapping
and BeatStep-NoteInput. Both scripts use an overlay in bitwig to show the
values of the mapped knobs. You can turn this of in the corresponding
*.control.js. There is a variable **SHOW_VALUES**, turn it to *false* and there
is no overlay anymore.


## BeatStep-MidiMapping

With this script, you can map the buttons and the knobs in controller mode.


## BeatStep-NoteInput

With this script, you can play the buttons like a keyboard and map the knobs.


## Installation

If this is your first installation of a controller script, you find here a
guide how this works:
